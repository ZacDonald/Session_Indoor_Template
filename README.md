# Session_Indoor_Template

A basic Unreal Engine project template designed for Session modding, based off the Session_Template by JammieDodgerr but tweaked to demostrate how to get better visuals for an interior space with fixed lighting. Should be a good starting point for indoor skateparks and warehouses. 

Also contains a custom blueprint from adding object reactions to player collisions.

Feel free to download and use it as a start for your own custom Session map project.
